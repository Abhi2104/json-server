      "title": "Poha ",
      "ingridents": "2 cups thick Poha (rice flakes)\n1 medium Onion, finely chopped (approx. 1/3 cup)\n1 small Potato, peeled and finely chopped (approx. ½ cup)\n1/3 teaspoon Mustard Seeds\n1/2 teaspoon Cumin Seeds\n8-10 Curry Leaves\n1 Green Chili, finely chopped\n1 pinch of Asafoetida (Hing), optional\n1½ tablespoon Peanuts (ground nuts)\n1/4 teaspoon Turmeric Powder\n1½ teaspoons Lemon Juice\n1/2 tablespoon Sugar\n1 tablespoon grated Coconut, optional\nSalt to taste\n2 tablespoons Oil\n1/4 cup Pomegranate Seeds, optional\n2 tablespoons finely chopped Coriander Leaves",
      "recipe": "1- To a strainer, add flattened rice (poha). Rinse it under running water until it turns soft.\n\n2- To check if it’s done, press a flake between your thumb and index finger, it should break easily.\n\n3- Add turmeric and 1/2 teaspoon salt to the poha and toss to combine. Set it aside while you make the tempering in the pan.\n\n4- Heat oil in a pan on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the mustard seeds and let them pop.\n\n5- Then add the chopped onion, green chili and curry leaves. Cook for 2 minutes until the onions soften.\n\n6- Add the green peas (which had been soaked in warm water for 10 minutes prior) and mix. Cook for 2 minutes until raw smell of peas goes away.\n\n7- Then add in the rinsed poha and toss to combine. Taste test some poha and if it feels dry, sprinkle little water all over (I usually do that). Cook for 1-2 minutes.  Also tastes test and add more salt as needed at this point (I added around 1/8 teaspoon).\n\nAlso add the sugar (if using) and cilantro.\n\n8- And then cover the pan with a lid and turn heat to low. Let it be like that for 2 minutes. Then turn off the heat."
